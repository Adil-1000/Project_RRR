# Analysis of RRR (Restorents, Ratings, and reviews)

## 📌 Project Overview
The "Analysis of RRR" project is focused on examining restaurant ratings, reviews, and recommendations to derive actionable insights that can help improve customer satisfaction and business performance. By analyzing data from popular platforms like Zomato and Swiggy, this project identifies patterns, trends, and key factors that contribute to restaurant success.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To identify the most popular restaurants based on taste, quantity, customer reviews, and ratings.
- To understand customer preferences and satisfaction levels.
- To detect trends in restaurant performance and highlight improvement areas.
- To provide data-driven recommendations for restaurant businesses.

## 🛠️ Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Scraping and aggregating data from online food delivery platforms.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing customer reviews, ratings, and feedback using Python.
- **Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs to represent findings effectively.
- **Recommendations**: Providing actionable suggestions based on analysis results.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
  - NLTK/TextBlob (for sentiment analysis)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

## 📊 Data Sources
- Aggregated datasets from Zomato and Swiggy (sample or publicly available datasets used for demonstration purposes).

## 📝 Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Importing restaurant data, including reviews, ratings, and metadata.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns in ratings, reviews, and popularity metrics.
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing customer reviews for sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
5. **Recommendation Generation**: Using machine learning algorithms to suggest top-rated restaurants.

## 🖼️ Sample Visualizations
- Heatmaps showing correlations between ratings and factors like quantity or price.
- Bar charts illustrating top-rated restaurants in a specific city.
- Word clouds highlighting common customer feedback keywords.

## 🔮 Future Work
- Expanding the dataset to include additional cities and cuisines.
- Integrating real-time data scraping for dynamic analysis.
- Implementing a dashboard for live visualization and exploration.
